## [blog.github.io](https://github.com/varHarrie/varharrie.github.io)

This repo is from [varHarrie](https://github.com/varHarrie/varharrie.github.io), and I made some change to adapt my blog.
The author's blog is here http://varharrie.me/#/

## How to use.
configure the file "blog_config.json". However I'm not good at javascript, I don't know how to load the rest of variable to the blog.js file. So, there're some hard codes right in blog.js. Search keywords "Gmail" and "Github", replace both two links with yours.
